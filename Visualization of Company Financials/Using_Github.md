Git pull (make sure you do this before doing any work, need to make sure that you aren’t working on out of date files)
File save locally
Git status (checks the changes that you have made and you can see them)
Git add . (added the changes and gets them ready for a commit)
Git commit -m “message” (commits the changes to the local repository on your computer)
Git push (pushes the changes from your local repo to the central repo)
Make branches (when necessary) to ensure that the main file doesn’t corrupted.
